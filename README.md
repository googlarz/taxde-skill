## What It Does

Finance Assistant covers the full personal finance lifecycle across 11 operating modes:

| Mode | What you say | What you get |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Budget Manager** | "how am I doing on my budget?" | Variance by category, overspend alerts, pace warnings |
| **Transaction Logger** | "I spent €42 at REWE" | Logged, auto-categorized, budget actuals updated |
| **Savings Planner** | "I want to save €10k for a trip" | Timeline projection, monthly contribution needed |
| **Investment Tracker** | "show my portfolio" | Allocation, total return, XIRR, rebalance suggestions |
| **Debt Optimizer** | "best way to pay off my debts?" | Avalanche vs snowball comparison, debt-free date, interest saved |
| **Tax Module** | "what can I deduct?" | Locale-specific deductions (German 2024-2026 bundled) |
| **Insurance Reviewer** | "do I have enough coverage?" | Coverage gap analysis, renewal alerts |
| **Net Worth Dashboard** | "where do I stand?" | Net worth with 7-domain health score and trend |
| **Data Import** | "import this DKB CSV" | Parse → preview → categorize → deduplicate → import |
| **Scenario Lab** | "should I rent or buy?" | Before/after comparison with multi-year projection |
| **Specialist Handoff** | complex case | Structured brief for a Steuerberater or financial adviser |

### Proactive Session Alerts

Every session start checks five domains automatically:
- Budget overspend or pacing warnings ("85% of Groceries used at 16% of month")
- Upcoming recurring payments in the next 7 days
- Savings goal deadlines within 45 days
- Tax filing deadlines within 45 days (German locale)
- Monthly FIRE progress bar (`[████████░░░░░░░░░░░░] 42.3% — €317k / €750k`)

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/googlarz/finance-assistant-skill.git
cd finance-assistant-skill
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Add as a Claude Code skill in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "skills": [
    {
      "name": "finance-assistant",
      "path": "/path/to/finance-assistant-skill"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then in Claude Code: `What's my financial health?`

### First Session

On first run, Finance Assistant:
1. Automatically adds `.finance/` to your `.gitignore` (prevents accidental commits of financial data)
2. Checks file permissions and warns if they're too open
3. Starts a lightweight onboarding to collect your profile

---

## How It Works

### Profile-First Architecture

Every session starts by loading your stored profile with `profile_manager.py`. All scripts operate on this profile + the `.finance/` data directory. Nothing is hardcoded; everything adapts to your locale, currency, and situation.

### Insight Pipeline

The insight engine (`insight_engine.py`) runs after every major data update. It dispatches to domain-specific generators:

```
budget_insights → savings_insights → investment_insights
→ debt_insights → insurance_insights → tax_insights → net_worth_insights
```

Each insight carries a 4-level status:
- `ready` — actionable right now
- `needs_input` — needs one more fact from you
- `needs_evidence` — needs a document or statement
- `detected` — background risk found, FYI

And a confidence label: `Definitive` | `Likely` | `Debatable` | `Avoid`

### Locale Plugin System

Tax rules are country-specific plugins in `locales/<country_code>/`. Each locale exports a standard interface:

```python
LOCALE_CODE = "de"
SUPPORTED_YEARS = [2024, 2025, 2026]
def get_tax_rules(year) -> dict
def calculate_tax(profile, year) -> dict
def get_filing_deadlines(year) -> list[dict]
def get_social_contributions(gross, year) -> dict
def generate_tax_claims(profile, year) -> list[dict]
```

The German locale is fully bundled. New locales can be scaffolded automatically via `locale_loader.py`.

### Multi-Currency

All amounts use the `Money` class (backed by `Decimal`) to avoid floating-point errors. Exchange rates are cached in `.finance/exchange_rates.json` with a 24-hour TTL; fallback rates are clearly marked as lower confidence.

---

## Data Storage Layout

All data is project-local in `.finance/`. No cloud sync, no external APIs, no telemetry.

```
.finance/
├── finance_profile.json          # Core profile (employment, housing, goals, preferences)

**What is never stored:**
- Bank login credentials, passwords, PINs, TANs
- Full IBAN or bank account numbers
- Credit card numbers or CVV codes
- Tax IDs, passport numbers, national IDs
- Raw document contents

---

## Security & Privacy

### Design Principles

1. **Local-only**: All data lives in `.finance/` on your machine. No network calls for your personal data. No telemetry. No cloud sync.
2. **Structured summaries, not raw data**: Transaction amounts and categories are stored, not raw bank statements or login sessions.
3. **You own the delete button**: Every data category can be deleted individually or all at once.
4. **Encryption at rest**: Fernet AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256 — the same authenticated encryption scheme used in production web services.
5. **Passphrase quality enforced**: The system rejects weak passphrases before encrypting (minimum 12 chars, character variety required), because a strong cipher with a weak key is still weak.
6. **Atomic writes**: Encrypted files are written to a `.enc.tmp` file first, then atomically renamed — a power failure or crash cannot leave a half-encrypted, unreadable file.
7. **File permissions**: `harden_permissions()` sets `.finance/` to `700` (owner-only directory) and all files to `600` (owner-only read/write). Other OS users on the same machine cannot read your data.
8. **Git guard**: On first session, `.finance/` is automatically added to `.gitignore` so financial data cannot be accidentally committed and pushed to a repository.
9. **Audit log**: Every significant data access (read, write, encrypt, export, delete) is logged to `audit/access_log.json` with a timestamp.
10. **Sanitize before sharing**: `sanitize_for_sharing(data)` strips all PII (names, employers, payees, addresses) before you share data to get help — financial amounts and structures are preserved.

### Encryption Details

```
Key derivation: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256
Iterations:     480,000 (NIST 2023 recommendation)
Salt:           16 bytes random per file (unique per encryption)
Cipher:         AES-128 in CBC mode (via Fernet)
MAC:            HMAC-SHA256 (Fernet built-in; prevents ciphertext tampering)
Encoding:       Base64url
Dependency:     pip install cryptography
```

Each file gets its own random salt. Two files encrypted with the same passphrase produce different ciphertexts — you cannot tell if two files contain the same data by comparing them.

The salt is stored alongside the ciphertext (standard practice — it only makes brute-force harder when combined with high iteration counts; it does not weaken the encryption).

### Encrypted Export

Backups can be encrypted before leaving your machine:

```python
# Encrypted backup — safe to store in cloud or email to yourself
export_all_data(passphrase="MyStr0ng!Passphrase")

# Plaintext export — keep offline only
export_all_data()
```

The encrypted export uses the same Fernet key derivation as individual file encryption. The passphrase is never stored anywhere.

### All Security Controls

```python
from scripts.data_safety import (
    get_privacy_summary,          # Full security status report
    get_data_inventory,           # Audit what's stored and where
    harden_permissions,           # chmod 600/700 on all .finance/ files
    check_permissions,            # Check for insecure file permissions
    ensure_gitignore_protection,  # Add .finance/ to .gitignore
    encrypt_sensitive_files,      # Encrypt profile, accounts, investments, debt
    decrypt_sensitive_files,      # Decrypt for use
    encrypt_file,                 # Encrypt a single file
    decrypt_file,                 # Decrypt a single file
    export_all_data,              # Export (plain or encrypted)
    import_data,                  # Import from export file
    delete_all_data,              # Permanent wipe (requires confirm=True)
    delete_category,              # Delete one category (requires confirm=True)
    sanitize_for_sharing,         # Strip PII before sharing for help
    get_access_log,               # View audit trail
)
```

### What Happens on First Session

```
skill.py (session start)
  ├── ensure_gitignore_protection()   # .finance/ → .gitignore
  ├── check_permissions()             # warn if group/world readable
  └── get_profile()                   # load or start onboarding
      └── (new user) show privacy statement
```

The privacy statement is shown once:

> *Your data lives only in `.finance/` on your machine — nothing is ever uploaded. You can encrypt it, export it, or delete it completely at any time. I never store bank credentials, card numbers, IBANs, or government IDs.*

### Threat Model

| Threat | Protection |
|--------|-----------|
| Another user on same machine reads your files | `harden_permissions()` — chmod 600/700 |
| Accidental `git push` of financial data | `ensure_gitignore_protection()` — automatic on session start |
| Laptop stolen, unencrypted disk | `encrypt_sensitive_files(passphrase)` + OS disk encryption (FileVault/LUKS) |
| Weak passphrase undermines AES | `_check_passphrase_strength()` — enforced before every encrypt call |
| Power failure during encryption corrupts file | Atomic write via `.enc.tmp` → `rename()` — POSIX atomic |
| Sharing data for help leaks names/employer | `sanitize_for_sharing()` — redacts all PII fields |
| Unexpected data access by a process | `get_access_log()` — timestamped audit trail |
| Cloud backup of export file exposes data | `export_all_data(passphrase=...)` — Fernet-encrypted export |

### Known Limitations

- **Memory**: Decrypted data resides in Python process memory while the skill is running. Python does not securely zero memory on deallocation. This is a fundamental Python limitation.
- **OS keychain**: Passphrases are not stored in the OS keychain (macOS Keychain, GNOME Keyring). You must provide the passphrase each session when using encrypted files. This is deliberate — no stored secret means no stored secret to steal.
- **Disk encryption**: If your disk is not encrypted (macOS FileVault, Linux LUKS), Fernet protects against OS-level access control bypass but not against forensic disk reads. Enable full-disk encryption for maximum protection.
- **Audit log**: The access log itself is protected by `harden_permissions()` but is not encrypted by default (it contains timestamps and action types, not financial amounts).

## Bank Statement Import

### Supported Formats

| Format | Banks / Sources |
|--------|----------------|
| CSV (auto-detected by header fingerprint) | DKB, ING-DiBa, Comdirect, N26, Wise (EUR), Revolut (EUR), generic fallback |
| MT940 | Any German bank (SWIFT standard) |
| OFX / QFX | Most German brokers, international banks |

### Import Flow

1. **Detect format** — header fingerprinting identifies the bank automatically
2. **Parse** — extract date, amount, payee, description
3. **Preview** — show first 10 transactions for review
4. **Confirm** — user approves before any data is written
5. **Auto-categorize** — keyword + payee rules assign categories
6. **Deduplicate** — exact-match deduplication against existing transactions
7. **Update** — account balance and budget actuals refreshed

### Auto-Categorization

`transaction_normalizer.py` maps transactions to 30 categories across 8 domains. `category_learner.py` remembers corrections and applies them to future imports from the same payee — the categorization improves over time.

## Example Conversations

### Budget Check

```
You:  How am I doing on my April budget?
FA:   €340 of €400 food budget used (85%) — 28 days into 30-day month. On pace.
      Transport: €112 / €150 (75%) — fine.
      Eating out: €89 / €80 — OVER by €9 ⚠

      Suggestion: €11 left in eating out. One meal left this month.
      Adjacent: Groceries has €60 remaining — cooking covers the gap.
```

### FIRE Calculation

```
You:  When can I retire if I invest €1,500/month?
FA:   FIRE number: €900,000  (€36,000 expenses ÷ 4% withdrawal rate)
      Current portfolio: €180,000
      Monthly investment: €1,500 at 7% average return

      Projected FIRE date: 2044 (18 years)
      Formula: FV = PV×(1+r)^n + PMT×((1+r)^n−1)/r

      Confidence: Likely (assumes 7% return; actual will vary)
      What changes it: every extra €200/month cuts ~1 year.
```

### Debt Optimization

```
You:  Best strategy to pay off my 3 loans?
FA:   Avalanche (highest rate first):
        Credit card €3,200 @ 18.9% → Car loan €8,600 @ 5.9% → Ratenkredit €13,000 @ 3.4%
        Interest saved vs minimum: €2,840 | Debt-free: Nov 2027

      Snowball (smallest balance first):
        Same order (happens to match) in this case
        Interest saved vs minimum: €1,920 | Debt-free: Feb 2028

      → Avalanche saves €920 more and finishes 3 months earlier.
        Choose snowball only if you need the win of a quick first payoff.
```

### Tax Deductions (German)

```
You:  What can I deduct this year?
FA:   Profile: angestellt, Berlin, homeoffice 3 days/week

      ✓ Arbeitnehmer-Pauschbetrag: €1,230 (automatic)
      ✓ Homeoffice: €6/day × 210 days = €1,260 (at cap)
      ✓ Pendlerpauschale: €0 (homeoffice replaces commute)
      ? Gewerkschaftsbeitrag: enter your amount
      ? Fortbildungskosten: any training expenses this year?

      Estimated refund above Pauschbetrag: ~€340
      Confidence: Likely (exact figure needs actual receipts)
```
